    "\n",
    "An outcome causally depends on a prior event if and only if the occurrence of the prior event implies that the outcome will occur, and the absence of the prior event implies that the outcome will not occur. The fundamental problem of causality is that, at an individual level, the prior event is either observed or not, and the alternative can only be imagined. Therefore, we restrict causal analyses to population level relationships. To establish a causal relationship, we must isolate the prior event and the outcome from other possible causal prior events. We do this by intervening in the world we are measuring, perhaps by designed experimentation. However, designed experiments are not practical or even possible in some situations and an alternative method to establish causal relationships is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces structural causal modeling, an anlytical method that supports causal inference. A structural causal model is a set of pre-specified relationships between variables, usually represented graphically, that satisfy a set of conditions allowing causal inference. This paper introduces 1) graphical models, specifically directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), 2) the concept of identifiability, which allows causal inference, and 3) parameter estimation for the identified model. We use the CAUSAL family of procedures in SAS/STAT: CAUSALGRAPH, CAUSALMED, and CAUSALTRT.\n",

    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broad sense, correlation is any relationship between two variables. Causation is a stronger relationship because the value of one variable induces the second variable to take its value. Causation can be quantified when the two variables are measured close in time, but with the cause always preceding the outcome. To establish a causal relationship, we must isolate the cause and outcome from other possible causal factors by intervening in the world we are measuring. To say this another way, causation is all about understanding the process that generated our data. It is not enough to discover relationships in the data, we must understand how those relationships were created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is a gentle introduction to causal inference using the method of structural causal models. The first section defines causality and describes the conditions necesary to declare causality from an analysis. This is followed by an introduction to directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs, which are instrumental to understanding and fitting structural models. Using the SASHELP.HEART data set, a DAG is constructed to support several analyses. For several causal factors of interest, we use the CAUSALGRAPH Procedure to identify adjustment sets containing factors that confound the causal factor of interest. Having identified the confounders, we use the CAUSALMED and CAUSALTRT Procedures to fit our structural causal models to estimate causal effects."

    "## Concepts and Properties of Causality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causality Defined\n",
    "\n",
    "An outcome O causally depends on a prior event C if and only if \n",
    "* The occurrence of C implies that O will occur, and \n",
    "* The absence of C implies that O will not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the world is usually not so simple because outcomes require a series of prior causes to occur. For example, eating too much cheesecake will result in weight gain, but only if you do not exercise enough to counter the caloric intake. Therefore, at least two causes are necessary, eating too much cheesecake and not exercising. A causal mechanism or chain of causal dependence is one in which C causes O if and only if there is a sequence of events $C$, $D_{1}$, $D_{2}$, ..., $D_{k}$, $O$ such that each event in the sequence causally depends on the previous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the definition concerns the manner in which the data are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counterfactual Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "If you observe both events C and O, then how can you know whether O will be absent in the absence of C? You cannot reverse time and refrain from eating cheesecake to observe whether you gain weight. Counterfactual thinking is imagining a world that was not observed but might have been.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental problem of causality is that, at the level of an individual (or experimental unit), only one world can exist, and the alternative cannot be observed; only one outcome can be observed on each unit. For example, it is impossible to verify if abstaining from eating cheesecake results in no weight gain. The good news is that, although unit-level causality cannot be quantified, under specific conditions that you will read about shortly, population-level causal effects can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Outcomes\n",
    "Potential outcomes is a concept that organizes and establishes a formal framework for counterfactual thinking. Potential outcomes are events that are possible under alternative paths. For example, an intervention of interest might be eating cheesecake and the outcome of interest is weight gain. We have two possible paths; eat the cheesecake and refrain from eating the cheesecake, and two potential outcomes, weight gain or no weight gain.\n",

    "_Table 1. Potential Outcomes_\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 shows N individuals in an experiment. $Y_{i}$(t) is the potential outcome for the $i^{th}$ individual; t=1 indicates treatment and t=0 indicates control (no treatment). For each individual, the observed outcome is shown in black whereas the alternative outcome is in red. Only one is possible because each individual can either receive the treatment or not. The difference between the treatment and no-treatment outcomes is the causal effect, which cannot be estimated at the individual level. To estimate a causal effect, we calculate the mean response for treatment, calculate the mean response under no treatment, and, after controlling for confounders (which we will discuss at length), compute the difference. This is known as the average causal effect (ACE) or average treatment effect (ATE).\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are a few assumptions that are needed to properly estimate ACE or ATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Causal Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assumptions.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "Figure 1. Assumptions for Causal Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the conditions that must be met to declare cause and effect from your analysis.\n",
    "* Positivity: Every study subject (unit) has a positive probability of being assigned to each of the treatments.\n",
    "* Stable Unit Treatment Value Assignment (SUTVA): A unit’s potential outcome is not affected by another unit’s treatment assignment.\n",
    "* Consistency: A unit’s potential outcome under a treatment is its realized outcome. \n",
    "* Ignorability: Given an appropriate set of confounders (Xs), a unit’s mechanism for being assigned to treatment can be ignored.\n",
    " \n",
    "Without positivity, it does not make sense to consider potential outcomes; if an individual has no chance of receiving one of the treatments, then there is no causal effect of treatment for that individual. SUTVA is necessary for causal effect to be defined, at the individual level, using only that individual. Sometimes it might be necessary to increase the number of potential outcomes to satisfy SUTVA, but that is a complication beyond the scope of this paper. Consistency allows us to use observed outcomes to estimate causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignorability is also known as unconfoundedness, ‘no missing confounders’, or exchangeability. Satisfying this assumption is at the heart of isolating a cause of interest from other possible causes. Formally, we assume [$Y_{i}$(0),$Y_{i}$(1)] ⊥ 𝑇|𝑋, where X is the set of confounding covariates. The key to a valid estimate of ACE is to account for confounding factors; that is, factors related to both the treatment assignment and the outcome. For example, in our cheesecake example, suppose we also measure each individual's rating about the importance of good health. One can imagine that the more important good health is to someone, the more probable that person will avoid cheesecake and the more likely they are to exercise during the study. An individual's view about health is related both to the treatment (eating cheesecake) and the outcome (weight gain). Therefore, we must control for opinions about health to understand the cause-and-effect relationship between eating cheesecake and weight gain. Later we will use graphs to visualize such relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods to control for confounders; via randomization, propensity scores, and stratification. We will learn how to choose an appropriate set of confounders, called an adjustment set, when we introduce the CAUSALGRAPH Procedure."

    "## Methods of Causal Analyses\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Randomized Controlled Trials\n",
    "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) have been the gold standard to estimate causal effects. RCTs are a broad class of experimental designs, usually in which humans are the experimental unit. RCTs are common in medical and drug development studies. The ‘C’ in RCT indicates a control group in the study against which a treatment or intervention is compared. The control group does not receive the treatment or intervention under study. The ‘R’ in RCT indicates randomization; i.e. the study participants are randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. Randomization eliminates the ability of study participants to choose whether they receive the treatment, thereby removing potential confounding between causal factors. For example, suppose an intervention is being studied to determine if it helps job seekers find work. If one of the sexes is more inclined to participate in the intervention and is more likely to find work, then sex confounds the effect of the intervention. Randomization balances the distributions of sex between the intervention and control groups, nullifying the potential confounding by sex by not allowing individuals to choose their group. To declare causality of the intervention, this must hold true for all potential confounding factors associated with individuals (e.g. age, income, etc.). Randomization isolates the intervention from other causal factors by balancing the distribution of confounders between intervention and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confounding factor is one that is related to both the treatment (the cause) and the outcome (the effect). If individuals with a specific profile are more likely to choose a treatment compared to those in other profiles, then the distributions of the covariates making up the profile might differ across the treatment groups, inducing relationships between cause and covariates. Randomization prevents these relationships. Formally, we can accept the assumption that potential outcomes and treatment assignment are independent; Y(t) ⊥ T, where T is treatment assignment. This is known as exchangeability in the RCT and epidemiological literature (see Greenland and Robins); we called this \"ignorability\" in the section about assumptions. Exchangeability means that the mean outcome of the treated would remain the same even if all subjects were treated, or the mean outcome of the control would be the same even if all subjects were not treated. Said another way, if the two groups were swapped, the resulting outcome means would not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling the Treatment: Propensity Scores\n",
    "Some studies cannot use randomization; for example, studies that are not prospective but instead use data that have already been collected for other reasons (e.g. medical records, customer transactions, utility consumption). Studies analyzing retrospective data have no opportunity to randomly assign individuals to treatment. However, observational data often contain the variables needed to conduct an analysis of interest. Propensity scores offer a way to isolate the cause of interest from confounding factors when randomization was not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propensity scores are probabilities of being assigned to the treatment group, t = 1; Pr⁡(T=1|X=x). They are estimated, usually by logistic regression, by specifying the binary treatment indicator as the response and covariates as predictors. A new data set is created in which the propensity scores are used to:\n",
    "* Match treatment and control observations by similar propensity scores for matched (pairs) analysis\n",
    "* Compute weights for a weighted analysis\n",
    "* Stratify observations by similar propensity scores to conduct a stratified analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to create conditional independence between the potential outcomes and the treatment assignment. Recall that under complete randomization we can assume [$Y_{i}$(0), $Y_{i}$(1)] ⊥ T. Using propensity scores, we assume [$Y_{i}$(0), $Y_{i}$(1)] ⊥ T|X, where X is the set of confounding covariates used to estimate the propensity scores. The difficulty is finding the appropriate set X, noting that all confounders must be in X; we cannot have any unobserved confounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSMATCH Procedure provides methods of weighting, stratification, and matching. The objective is to achieve a balance of confounder distributions across treatment groups. Therefore, PROC PSMATCH assesses covariate balance by comparing distributions between the adjusted treated and control groups and creates a new data set for analysis of the cause of interest. You must specify the set X that PROC PSMATCH uses to estimate the propensity scores. PROC PSMATCH will not help you identify an appropriate set X, nor will it tell you if you have used an appropriate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Lamm et al. (2019) for more information about potential outcomes analysis using PROC PSMATCH.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the CAUSALTRT Procedure to model propensity scores, which we introduce at the end of the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling the Treatment: Structural Causal Models\n",
    "We now turn our attention to structural causal modeling (SCM). “Structural” refers to a pre-specified data generating process which we will represent graphically. “Causal” implies that the graphical model will adhere to conditions that permit causal interpretation of the relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we describe visual representation of SCMs using directed acyclic graphs, define three graph constructs useful for understanding adjustment sets, link graphical models to model analyses, and demonstrate the use of the procedures in the CAUSAL family of procedures: CAUSALGRAPH, CAUSALMED, and CAUSALTRT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Directed Acyclic Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"DAG.jpg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Figure 2. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical model is a visualization of relationships between variables. Variables are represented by nodes and relationships by connecting edges or arcs. Depending on the type of model, connectors can be single- or double-headed arrows. Connectors can begin and end at the same node. The absence of a connector between two nodes means that the variables are independent of each other.\n",
    "Figure 2 shows a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a special kind of graphical model. Letters A – G represent nodes. The graph is directed because each arc between two nodes is uniquely directed and is acyclic because no cycles or loops exist (e.g. A→B→C→A). A node from which a directed edge starts is called the parent of the node to which the edge is directed; a node on which a directed edge ends is called the child of the node from which it originates. For example, nodes B and C are parents of node A, and node A is the common child of nodes B and C. With respect to node A, nodes B, C, and F are ancestors, and nodes D, E, and H are descendants. Parents and children of a node are the neighbors of the node. Spouses are nodes sharing the same child, such as A and G.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"BlockingConstructs.jpg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Figure 3. Graph Constructs and Blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 3, two nodes, T and M, have been added to our DAG example. We are interested in estimating the causal effect of treatment T on outcome O. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic constructs of nodes (or sets of nodes) in a DAG.\n",
    "1.\tA causal path is a directed path from cause to outcome. The path might have intermediate nodes called mediators, like node M in Figure 3.\n",
    "2.\tA confounding node, like node C, is a parent of both the cause of interest and the outcome.\n",
    "3.\tA collider node, like node E, is a child of both the cause of interest and the outcome. This construct is called “endogenous selection”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cause of interest, the treatment, and the outcome are associated in the causal and confounding constructs. They are not associated via a collider. To isolate the causal effect of interest, we need to disassociate the treatment and outcome in all confounding paths. At the same time, we must not disassociate the treatment and outcome in the causal path nor introduce a confounding association via a collider.\n",
    "\n",
    "To disassociate two nodes that have a natural association via a confounding path, we must “block” the path.  \n",
    "1.\tWe do not want to block the T->M->O path because this is the cause of interest. If we mistakenly do block this path, the resulting bias in our analysis is called “overcontrol bias”.\n",
    "2.\tWe do want to block the T->C->O path to disassociate O from T via C. Doing so will isolate the causal path of interest. If we mistakenly do not block a confounding path, then our analysis will suffer “confounding bias”.\n",
    "3.\tWe do not want to block the T->E->O path because there is no association between T and O in this path. If we block this path, then we will create a confounding association and introduce “endogenous selection bias”.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Collider.jpg\" width=\"100\">\n",
    "Figure 4. Colliders and Endogenous Selection Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example might help explain endogenous selection bias. Consider an outcome of risk status for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). One of the measured variables is quality of life (QOL), quantified using a questionnaire. The outcome of interest, CHD, causes below normal QOL. A CHD treatment under study is expected to lower the risk of CHD and increase QOL, perhaps by returning patients to normal levels of daily activities. Figure 4 is the graphical model, where T is the treatment node, D is the disease node and Q is the QOL node. The objective of the study is to estimate the direct effect of treatment on CHD risk. Focusing on QOL, if you do not know the QOL level, then you have no information regarding the treatment status or CHD risk. However, if you know that QOL is very low, then you know that it is more likely that the patient is not receiving the treatment and that CHD risk is high. By setting or controlling the level of QOL, i.e. by blocking the Q node, you will induce a relationship between treatment and disease that did not naturally exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Blocking” is a graphical term, and “adjusting, controlling, and conditioning” are statistical terms. In the next section we link graphs to analyses and state that blocking in graphs is accomplished through adjustment in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D-Separation\n",
    "Graphical models help us visualize data generating processes and variable dependencies. But the graphical models are not analyses that estimate causal effects; we need statistical analysis methods.  They are connected through the concept of d-separation.  To make the transition from graphical models to inferential statistical methods, it is helpful to be aware of d-separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “D” in d-separation stands for “directional”. Two nodes are d-separated when there is no connecting path between them. If a connecting path does exist, then they are d-connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In graphical terms:\n",
    "* Two nodes are d-separated when every path between them is blocked\n",
    "* Two nodes are d-connected if at least one path between them is unblocked \n",
    "\n",
    "The transition to statistical methods is (Pearl et al., 2016, p46):\n",
    "* If two nodes are d-separated, then the variables they represent are definitely independent\n",
    "* If two nodes are d-connected, then the variables they represent are possibly or likely dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "We block paths via conditioning on or adjusting for variables whose nodes are in confounding paths, or by the presence of colliders. \n",
    "\n",
    "PROC CAUSALGRAPH tells us which nodes to condition on by identifying valid adjustment sets. It also indicates which nodes to never include in an adjustment set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"bold\">$CAUTION$ Causal graphs are comprised of nodes that represent variables. The graphs do not consider the shape of relationships between variables or distributions of those variables. When transitioning to causal analyses, it is important to keep this in mind if you use parametric methods, e.g. regression. Ideally, we would use non-parametric methods. But this is not always possible.\n",

    "The CAUSALGRAPH Procedure in SAS/STAT® Software identifies nodes that must be, or can be, blocked to isolate a causal path of interest. This can be for planning an analysis of data already collected, or for planning a data collection effort for a designed experiment or study. If the data have not yet been collected, you can use PROC CAUSALGRAPH to learn which variables must be measured. When a causal path can be isolated, i.e. all confounding paths can be blocked, we say that the causal path is identified. An adjustment set includes the variables that you need to condition on, or adjust for, during your analysis to facilitate valid causal inferences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Unlike many SAS Procedures, PROC CAUSALGRAPH does not have a DATA= option on the PROC CAUSALGRAPH statement; no data are needed. You specify your DAG on the MODEL statement and the causal path of interest on the IDENTIFY statement. If any of the nodes represent variables that are (or will be) unmeasured, you specify them on the UNMEASURED statement. Unmeasured nodes cannot be blocked, so it is important to specify such nodes.\n",

PROC CAUSALMED conducts mediation analyses for causal interpretation. Figure 7 displays our simple graph model with treatment, mediator, outcome, and confounder nodes. An edge connecting treatment to outcome has been added to facicilitate separate estimates for direct and indirect (via the mediator) effects. CAUSALMED fits generalized linear models for the measurement scales listed in Figure 7.\n",

    "Figure 8 displays selected syntax for the CAUSALMED Procedure. You must specify one, and only one, for each of the treatment, mediator, and outcome variables. You may specify multiple confounders and their interactions. You specify categorical variables on the CLASS statement as you do in other procedures. On the MODEL statement, the outcome variable, CHD5YR, is specified to the left of the = sign and the treatment and mediator variables to the right. The MEDIATOR statement is, in effect, another modeling statement. Specify the mediator variable to the left of the = sign and the treatment variable to the right. The confounders that you list on the COVAR statement are used in both the treatment and mediator models. You can specify interactions using the vertical line and star notation as in other modeling procedures. For example, we could use MRW|SMOKING to include the main effects and two-way interaction in the models. Use the EVALUATE statement to specify levels of a covariate at which you want causal estimates. In the PROC CAUSALMED step below, we are estimating the causal effect of cholesterol on cardiac heart disease. From our DAG, we presume that blood pressure status has a mediating effect. From our indentification analysis using PROC CAUSALGRAPH, we know that we need to control for MRW and SMOKING. On the EVALUATE statement, we are requesting cholesterol effect estimates for someone who smokes 60 cigarettes per day. By default, PROC CAUSALMED will use the mean of the covariates. This is like the “AT variable=value” syntax on an LSMEANS statement in a modeling procedure.\n",

    "$O_{t,m}$ is the value of the outcome at treatment t and mediator m. For simplicity, Figure 9 assumes that treatment and mediator are both binary; level 0 stands for a control group. Because treatment has a causal relationship with the mediator, we distinguish the value of the mediator when treatment is 0 versus 1. $M_{t}$ is the value of the mediator when treatment is at level t. Total effect is the sum of direct (treatment to outcome) and indirect (mediator to outcome) effects, which we denote using solid lines in Figure 9. Note that we are not intervening on the mediator, rather it takes the value caused by the treatment; when under treatment, the mediator assumes the value $M_{1}$ and when under control, the mediator assumes value $M_{0}$.\n",

In Figure 10, we denote this situation by removing the edges from treatment to mediator (setting the value of the mediator removes any effect of treatment on mediator), and by using dashed edges for the indirect effect (setting the value of the mediator forces the indirect effect to be equal under treatment and control. \n",

Because these data were generated prospectively and have not been over-sampled, we can use the relative risk estimates.\n",

    "In the CHD example, our treatment, cholesterol, is continuous. Recall that we divided the raw values by 10. Therefore, our effect estimates correspond to a 10 unit increase in cholesterol. A 10 unit increase in cholesterol directly causes an increase of 6.87% in the risk of coronary heart disease within 5 years. It indirectly causes an additional increase of 1.39% via blood pressure status. The total effect is 8.26% increase in the risk of CHD within 5 years. The percent of the total effect due to mediation is 16.88% and is also provided in the output. These estimates were produced at the mean values of the covariates.\n",

    "Recall that, using the EVALUATE statement, we requested additional estimates for the subpopulation of those smoking 3 packs per day (at mean MRW). The relative risk estimates did not change, so smoking more cigarettes does not impact the effect of cholesterol on CHD. This does not mean that smoking does not affect CHD!\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the affect of smoking on coronary heart disease we can run the PROC CAUSALMED step below. We again refer to our PROC CAUSALGRAPH output to ensure we use the correct adjustment set to analyze smoking. Age is the only covariate that we must control. Smoking appears to have a small but significant direct effect, but no indirect effect via blood pressure status."

They are estimated, usually by logistic regression, by specifying the binary treatment indicator as the response and covariates as predictors. We also learned that we can use the propensity scores  to compute weights for a weighted analysis. \n",

Conditional independence is satisfied if you adjust for all confounders; factors that impact both the treatment and outcome. The adjustment set is identified by PROC CAUSALGRAPH. If the graphical model that we specified in PROC CAUSALGRAPH is an accurate representation of the data generating process, and we specify the adjustment set on both the MODEL and PSMODEL statements, then we satisfy the independence assumption.\n",

If only the outcome model is specified, then REGADJ is used by default. And if only the treatment model is specified, then IPWR is used. If neither model is specified, then REGADJ is used. AIPW and IPWREG are known as doubly robust because the final ATE combines estimates from both the propensity score and regression methods. These methods are called doubly robust because you obtain unbiased estimates of the ATE even if one of the models, treatment our outcome model, is mis-specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have written the PROC CAUSALTRT step below to estimate the ATE for blood pressure status. Recall from our PROC CAUSALGRAPH results that cholesterol and smoking comprise an adjustment set for the causal path from blood pressure status to coronary heart disease. Therefore, we specify cholesterol and smoking as inputs in both the model for treatment assignment (PSMODEL statement) and for the outcome (MODEL statement). There is no procedural requirement that the models be the same. Because the procedure supports multiple distributions for the outcome, we specify the binomial distribution on the MODEL statement. The PALL option on the PROC CAUSALTRT statement requests all output tables, some of which are not displayed by default.\n",

    "Review the model information to be sure your model was specified as intended. The Analysis of Causal Effect table is the main output table and is produced by default (even if PALL is not specified). The table shows the population mean outcome for each level of the binary treatment variable. The ATE is the difference.\n",

    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is a gentle introduction to causality and structural causal models. The first step in a causal analysis using structural causal models is to draw your system of variables in a directed acyclic graph. Then code your DAG in PROC CAUSALGRAPH to identify adjustment sets of confounders that you must control in your causal analysis. With an adjustment set identified, if you can satisfy the four assumptions and if you practice good modeling principles, then you can safely make causal inferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced to modeling procedures, PROC CAUSALMED, for mediation analyses, and PROC CAUSALTRT, for estimates of average treatment effect. PROC CAUSALTRT provides two modeling approaches; modeling the treatment by fitting a propensity score model, and modeling the outcome by fitting a structural causal model."
